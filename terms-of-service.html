    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>MyLeadScout is a Google Sheets Add-on that enables users to search for local business information using the Google Places API (New). The Add-on operates on a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model. Users must provide their own Google Maps API key to use the search functionality.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>By using MyLeadScout, you agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will provide your own valid Google Maps API key.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for any costs incurred through your use of the Google Places API, as billed by Google to your Google Cloud account.</li>

      <li>You are solely responsible for how you use the business data retrieved through the Add-on.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. API Key Security</h2>
    <p>Your Google Maps API key is stored securely within Google's infrastructure using the UserProperties service. While we have designed the Add-on to handle your key securely, you are responsible for:</p>

      <li>Keeping your API key confidential.</li>
      <li>Setting appropriate API key restrictions in your Google Cloud Console.</li>
      <li>Monitoring your API usage and billing in Google Cloud Console.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</li>
      <li>Warranties that the Add-on will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure.</li>
      <li>Warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of data returned by the Google Places API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the developers of MyLeadScout shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>

      <li>Loss of profits, data, or business opportunities.</li>

      <li>Any damages resulting from unauthorized access to or alteration of your data.</li>
      <li>Any errors or inaccuracies in the business data retrieved.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>8. Modifications to the Service</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Add-on at any time, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the service.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>

      <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If you experience technical issues that prevent the Add-on from functioning and we are unable to resolve them, contact us at <strong>m70creativelabs@gmail.com</strong> and we will work with you on a case-by-case basis.</li>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
